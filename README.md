## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js >= 18
* Docker & Docker Compose
* `npm` or `yarn`

### Option 1: Running with Docker (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get the application running with all dependencies.

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timi-busari/wallet-management
cd wallet-management
```


#### 2. Build and Start All Services

```bash
# Build and start all services (PostgreSQL, Redis, and the app)
docker-compose up --build
```

#### 3. Initialize Database and Seed Data

In a new terminal window, run the following commands:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
docker exec -it wallet-app yarn prisma:generate

# Run database migrations
docker exec -it wallet-app yarn prisma:migrate

# Seed the database with initial data
docker exec -it wallet-app yarn prisma:seed
```

#### 4. Access the Application

* **API**: http://localhost:3000

#### 5. Stopping the Services

```bash
# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (clears all data)
docker-compose down -v
```

---

### Option 2: Local Development Setup

If you prefer to run the application locally without Docker for the app itself:

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timi-busari/wallet-management
cd wallet-management
```

#### 2. Start Required Services Only

```bash
# Start only PostgreSQL and Redis
docker-compose up -d postgres redis
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

#### 4. Setup Environment

Create a `.env` file:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=wallet_user
DB_PASSWORD=wallet_password
DB_NAME=wallet_system

DATABASE_URL="postgresql://${DB_USERNAME}:${DB_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}:${DB_PORT}/${DB_NAME}?schema=public"

# Redis Configuration
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

# Queue Configuration
QUEUE_REDIS_HOST=localhost
QUEUE_REDIS_PORT=6379

# API Configuration
API_KEY=6pfrn00011248xivxkz0t
CORS_ORIGIN=*
```

#### 5. Initialize Database

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma db seed
```

#### 6. Start the Application

```bash
npm run start:dev
# or
yarn start:dev
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Test with coverage
npm run test:cov
```

### Running Tests in Docker

```bash
# Run tests inside the container
docker exec -it wallet-app npm test

# Run tests with coverage
docker exec -it wallet-app npm run test:cov
```

## üß± Architecture Decisions

### ‚úÖ Assumptions Made

* A user can only have one active wallet at a time.
* Transfers are split into two separate transactions: `TRANSFER_OUT` and `TRANSFER_IN`.
* All transactional operations should be processed asynchronously for scalability.
* Transaction retries should be safe and idempotent.

### üìå Key Design Decisions

* **Prisma ORM** is used for DB access with PostgreSQL.
* **Bull** is used for processing deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
* **Redis** serves as both a cache and job queue backend.
* **Decimal.js** is used to handle all monetary operations accurately.
* **Optimistic Locking** ensures transactional updates are safe from race conditions.
* **Idempotency** is enforced by `referenceId` field to prevent duplicates.
* Prisma query logs are enabled via `$on()` for visibility during development.

## üîê Security

All APIs are secured with an API Key. Add the following header to every request:

```http
wallet-api-key: your-secure-api-key
```

The default API key is `6pfrn00011248xivxkz0t`. You can customize this value in `.env`.
